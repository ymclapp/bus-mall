# Lab-15: bus-mall

The bus-mall is the bus version of the eccentric advertising magazine found in seat-back pockets on airplanes.  The magazine would be on buses and allow people to view it electronically.  We were to create a website that would allow users to vote on the items that they would be interested in seeing in the magazine.  Additionally, we provided stats on the number of times an image was clicked and the number of times an image was shown.

## Setup and Documentation

This is the assignment for starting the bus-mall:  https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1793723/assignments/13339181?module_item_id=27287547

This is the assignment to add the chart for tracking clicks and shows:  https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1793723/assignments/13339182?module_item_id=27287552

To first set up the mall we needed to create the repo, scaffolding, the reset css, css, images folder, and js folder.  We needed to get the index established so that it would hold our images, chart, and results.  A header had to be set up as well as the tab label.

## User Stories and Feature Tasks

Our client wanted to be able to have  the images provided to the user, allow them to click on one of the three images presented, and not allow the images to repeat too soon after just being presented.  From the user clicks and such, the client wanted to be able to see a running total of results of the clicks and the number of times a given image was shown.

### Stretch Goals

1. One of the biggest stretch goals was to prepare the coding for the future requirements

## Getting Started

That they should start with the basic outline and move on from there.  Styling might be one of the things they do as they go along or more to do at the end so that it beautifies the site once everything is in place.  Remember to work in branches and not on the master.

## Submission Instructions

We are to push the code to master and provide the push request.  After that is submitted, then we are to review and merge to the master.
